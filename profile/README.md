# Climate Dynamics Lab ðŸŒ±

## Who are we? ðŸ‘¥
The [Climate Dynamics Lab](https://mutz.science/) is a small, international network of scientists clustered around specific research topics. We keep an open-door policy to anyone interested in working on these topics (as a researcher, developer or communicator). [Get in touch](mailto:sebastian@mutz.science) if you have questions, comments, or would like to join us!

## What do we do? ðŸŒ€
The Climate Dynamics Lab tackles research questions in the disciplines of atmospheric science, climate - Earth surface interactions, and climate change impacts (see [list of publications](https://mutz.science/res/pub.html)). This includes research driven by scientific curiosity (e.g., "How did the formation of mountains impact climate and biodiversity over millions of years?"), as well as research and development driven by some of the most pressing global issues (e.g., "How do we deliver climate impact predictions on spatiotemporal scales that are needed by decision makers?").
