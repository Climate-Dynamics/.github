## Climate Dynamics Lab ðŸŒ€
The [Climate Dynamics Lab](https://mutz.science/) is a small, international network of scientists clustered around specific research topics (see [list of publications](https://mutz.science/res/pub.html)). We keep an open-door policy to anyone interested in working on these topics (as a researcher, developer or communicator). [Get in touch](mailto:sebastian@mutz.science) if you have questions, comments, or would like to join us!
